# About me

## Hello, world!

I'm a recent graduate with a Master's degree in Natural Resources and Environmental Studies from the University of Northern BC, where I worked under the supervision of Dr. Balbinder Deo. My research focused on estimating food loss and waste in restaurant operations through an in-depth case study—a topic that bridges my academic interests with real-world sustainability challenges.

Currently, I'm seeking opportunities to apply my research skills and passion for environmental studies in a professional setting. My academic journey has equipped me with expertise in quantitative analysis and a deep understanding of resource management, while my hands-on experience has given me practical insights into the food service industry.

## What is Himagineer?

The word Himagineer blends the Japanese concept of "Hima" (暇), representing leisure or free time, with the English term "Imagineer," signifying someone who creates and shares innovative ideas. For me, Himagineer encapsulates a personal philosophy: it's during these moments of "Hima" – my leisure time – that I dedicate myself to "imagineering" pleasant information. This means engaging in activities where I can create, innovate, and share insights, turning personal pursuits into a source of shared knowledge and inspiration.

## What drives my curiosity:

**Economics & Analysis**

Consumer Theory in Microeconomics

Managerial Economics

Costs and Inventory Analysis

Generational Accounting Model

Regression Analysis in Statistics

Experimental Design

State-Space (Bayesian) Model

**Emerging Technologies**

Text Analysis in Computational Social Science

**Real-World Application**

Cooking!! 

I've spent over ten years working in Chinese and Japanese restaurants, gaining invaluable experience in food preparation, kitchen operations, and understanding the practical challenges of food waste reduction.

This unique combination of academic rigour and industry experience shapes my perspective on sustainability, economics, and the intersection of theory and practice. Through this blog, I'll share insights from my research, thoughts on current topics in environmental studies, statistics, and economics, and perhaps a few culinary adventures along the way.

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you find something here that sparks your interest!
