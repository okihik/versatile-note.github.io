## From Static Scripts to Interactive Simulation

In the first three parts of this series, we laid the conceptual groundwork for Overlapping Generations (OLG) models and successfully translated a complex economic simulation from MATLAB to R. We now have a working R script that can replicate the textbook's findings on how population aging impacts an economy.

But what if we want to ask our own questions? What if we want to see what happens under a *different* tax policy? Or explore the effects of higher government debt? Running a new simulation for every single scenario would be tedious.

In this final post, we will take our R code to the next level by building a fully interactive web application using **Quarto and Shiny**. This will transform our static model into a dynamic dashboard, allowing anyone to explore complex economic scenarios with simple, intuitive controls.

## Why Quarto and Shiny?

**Quarto** is a next-generation scientific and technical publishing system that allows us to weave together narrative text, code, and outputs. **Shiny** is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R. When combined, they are the perfect toolkit for our project:

*   **Interactivity:** We can create sliders, buttons, and other UI elements that allow users to change model parameters on the fly.
*   **Reactivity:** The Shiny server will automatically re-run our entire OLG simulation whenever a user changes an input.
*   **Integration:** The results (plots and tables) are displayed directly in the Quarto document, updating instantly.
*   **Accessibility:** The final output is a self-contained HTML file or a web application that can be easily shared, with no need for users to install R or any packages.

## Building the Application

We will structure our application within a single Quarto (`.qmd`) file. The file has two main components:

1.  **The Sidebar (UI):** This panel will contain our interactive sliders. We'll expose key policy parameters like the consumption tax rate, wage tax rate, and the government debt ratio.
2.  **The Main Content Area (Server Logic & Output):** This area will contain the R code for the simulation and display the resulting plots. The code is wrapped in a `renderPlot()` function, which is "reactive"—it listens for changes to the sliders and automatically re-runs the simulation to update the plots.

### The Complete Quarto Shiny App Code

Below is the complete, corrected code for the application.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# Load necessary libraries and helper functions
library(shiny)
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
# These files must be in the same directory as this .qmd file.
source("STEADY1.R")
source("UDIF1.R")
```

## Conclusion of the Series

This journey began with a theoretical question: how can we model the long-term economic impact of demographic change? We found our answer in a classic Japanese textbook on OLG models. Over four posts, we have:

1.  Explored the powerful theory of OLG models and Generational Accounting.
2.  Translated the model's foundational code from MATLAB to R, calculating its steady state.
3.  Implemented the full transition dynamics, simulating the economy's evolution over 150 years.
4.  Wrapped our R code into a polished, interactive Shiny application.

This project demonstrates the complete pipeline from academic theory to practical, interactive data science. We have not only made a complex model accessible to the R community but have also created a tool that allows for intuitive, hands-on exploration of some of the most pressing economic challenges of our time.

Thank you for following along in this series. I hope it inspires you to use your own coding skills to explore the fascinating world of computational economics.
